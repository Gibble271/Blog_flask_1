# Discussion Forum Using Flask and Sqlalchemy (updated: 12/24/20)
## Summary:
For this project, I will be creating a discussion forum(something like Reddit) that allows Users to join communities to discuss their interests. A user is allowed to join multiple communities and post up discussions in those communities. The user can post videos, pictures and links on the discussions. 

Other users can join in the discussion and comment on it. The other users can like and dislike any comments, and upvote and downvote any discussions. The upvote and downvote allows users to sort the most popular and unpopular topic in the community.

## Personal Goals:
* To create a discussion forum using Flask and SqlAlchemy on my own
* Reinforce what I have learn from class
* Learn Html And CSS
